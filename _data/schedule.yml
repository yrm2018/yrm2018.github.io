Germanium offers this possibility in principle, although it is an indirect gap material. Recently it has been proposed to circumvent the problem of an indirect gap material by growing germanium carbide (Ge:C) alloys. In doing so it has been proposed that a direct gap material at very low C content can be achieved, which is capable for use in lasers and other silicon photonic devices. However, very little is known about its fundamental properties. We aim here to establish an accurate and detailed understanding of the electronic properties of Ge:C alloys. We do so by applying hybrid functional density functional theory to gain insight into the electronic structure of these alloys. To study band mixing effects, which are crucial for understanding and predicting optical properties, calculations have been performed at different cell pressures. Such an approach offers the  possibility for future comparison with experiment. We cover here the experimentally relevant C concentration range of approx. 1%. Our calculations reveal strong band mixing with as little as 0.78% C. These mixing effects affect the band gap variation with pressure significantly and finally shed light onto the nature of the band gap of these novel materials.",          para: "This talk will introduce the fundamental concepts needed to interpret plasmon satellites in photoelectron spectra, and it will review recent progress on first-principles calculations of these features using many-body perturbation theory.",

It has been shown recently that increasing the proximity to such phase transition in (Pb,Ge)Te alloys leads to significantly reduced lattice thermal conductivity, and potentially enhanced thermoelectric figure of merit. Here, we analyze the influence of the ferroelectric phase transition on the thermo-mechanical properties of GeTe, such as thermal expansion and elastic constants. We model thermal expansion using density functional theory by minimizing Helmholtz free energy using the elastic and harmonic approximations and Gruneisen theory. Accounting for the temperature dependence of elastic constants, we obtain the temperature variation of the structural parameters of rhombohedral GeTe in very good agreement with experiment. Most importantly, we correctly reproduce a negative volume thermal expansion of GeTe near the phase transition at ~700 K. Our model shows that the coupling between acoustic and soft transverse optical modes is the dominant mechanism that induces negative thermal expansion."

Despite the plethora of approximations for the XC energy functional only a few have been used for the XC kernel. Out of these, only the ALDA kernel has been implemented and applied to study the magnetic excitations.

For instance, in the research of transmission through a thin Al film, core excitation plays a salient role in absorption of photons. And, to describe the ultra-fast dynamics of this excitation(faster than Auger decay), a real-time approach like Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory(TDDFT) is necessary. However numerically it's hard to capture the motion of holes from the core excitation as they concentrate locally near each nucleus.

Accurately describing molecule-field interactions can directly impact the design of new experiments, ranging from the investigation of ultrafast dynamics in small molecules, the development of new metamaterials, to the coherent diffractive imaging of biological samples. To do this, one usually requires sophisticated quantum mechanical approaches that consider all major electronic, nuclear motion, and external field effects to high a degree of accuracy.",

Currently, our main emphasis is on the effects of internal (hyperfine) and external (laser) electromagnetic field interactions. We focus on methods that are general, highly accurate and therefore quantitatively predictive, but at the same time applicable to large complex molecular systems of the kind faced in real-world situations.",

Beyond the strong local correlations of the dynamical mean field, critical fluctuations on all length scales are included by means of a ladder diagram summation. Analysis of the susceptibility yields an estimate of the critical interaction strength of the quantum phase transition from a paramagnetic semimetal to an antiferromagnetic insulator, in good agreement to other numerical methods. We further estimate the crossover temperature to the renormalized classical regime.

        content: [
          para: "Perovskite rare-earth nickelates, \textit{R}NiO3, display a rich phase diagram with coupled structural, magnetic, and electronic degrees of freedom. All compounds with \textit{R} from Pr to Lu undergo a metal-insulator transition (MIT) that is accompanied by a structural distortion, which breaks the symmetry between formerly equivalent Ni sites and can be understood as a charge disproportionation of the Ni^{3+} cations into Ni^{2+} and Ni^{4+}. Both the transition temperature as well as the strength of the charge disproportionation vary strongly as function of the rare-earth ion. We explore the complex interplay between lattice distortions and electronic correlation effects in these compounds. To do so, we decompose the structure into distortion modes, which allows us to determine the structural ground state of the system by varying the different structural degrees of freedom individually and comparing total energies calculated within charge self-consistent density functional theory plus dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT) approach. Moreover, we employ the constraint random phase approximation (cRPA) method to calculate interaction parameters in the e_g-e_g correlated subspace and reveal a strong reduction of the effective Coulomb interaction U due to screening, which also increases across the series from \textit{R}=Lu to La. Accurate structural trends across the series are then derived and the subtle influence of the interaction parameters  U and J is analyzed. Therefore, our results demonstrate the successful description of the coupled structural and metal-insulator transition in rare-earth nickelate compounds without empirical parameters.",

Efforts to describe the damping from first principles have been made for almost 50 years [1]. A multitude of approaches to calculate the damping have been proposed since then [1,2,3]. Still, a disparity between different theoretical approaches persists. In particular, the behavior of clean ferromagnets at low temperatures is still debated [4]. In this work, we present calculations of the damping parameter for clean Fe, Ni and Co systems using a unified framework to investigate different approaches to understand the origin of their disparities.

        content: [
          para: "The interplay between Kondo effect, indirect magnetic interaction and geometrical frustration is studied in the Kondo lattice on the onedimensional zig-zag ladder. Using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), the ground state and various short- and long-range spin- and density-correlation functions are calculated for the model at half-filling as a function of the antiferromagnetic Kondo interaction down to J=0.3t where t is the nearest-neighbor hopping. Geometrical frustration is shown to lead to at least two critical points: Starting from the strong-J limit, where almost local Kondo screening dominates, antiferromagnetic correlations between nearestneighbor and next-nearest-neighbor local spins become stronger and stronger, until at J^dim_c approx 0.895t frustration is alleviated by a spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry and a corresponding transition to a dimerized state. Furthermore, within the symmetry-broken dimerized state, our data suggest a magnetic transition to a 90^° quantum spin spiral with quasi-long-range order at J^mag_c approx 0.84. The quantum-critical point is characterized by a diverging spin-structure factor S(q) at wave vector q = pi/2 and the closure of the spin gap (based on system sizes up to L=40). This is opposed to the model on the one-dimensional bipartite chain, which is known to have a finite spin gap for all J>0 at half-filling.",

Although the equilibrium phase diagram is still under lively debate both theoretically and experimentally, no convincing evidence has been presented for the AF-WSM, and it appears that all the known compounds are antiferromagnetic insulators (AFI). Here we propose an ultrafast nonthermal pathway to engineer a nonequilibrium AF-WSM phase with short laser pulses. Motivated by Floquet-Weyl semimetallic states in non-magnetic 3D Dirac materials, we investigate the dynamics after an interaction quench in a mean-field dynamics simulation starting from the AFI phase. We find nonthermal magnetic phases with Weyl fermions that emerge on femtosecond time scales. Possible experimental setups to realize our proposed scheme are discussed.",

For statically correlated systems, we introduce the conceptually new CAS-ext-gap assumption for multi-reference problems that replaces the assumption of a sufficiently large HOMO-LUMO gap. This new assumption is in particular useful for strongly correlated electronic systems. We characterize the TCC function and show local strong monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity such that Zarantonello's Theorem yields locally unique solutions fulfilling a quasi-optimal error bound for the TCC method. We perform an energy error analysis revealing the mathematical complexity of the TCC-method. Due to the basis-splitting nature of the TCC formalism, the error decomposes into several parts. Using the Aubin-Nitsche-duality method we derive a quadratic (Newton type) error bound valid for the linear-tensor-network TCC scheme DMRG-TCC and other TNS-TCC methods.",

We analyze the competition between the near-field short range dipole-dipole energy exchange processes and the cavity mediated long-range interactions in a simplified model consisting of effective two-level quantum emitters that could be relevant for molecules in experiments under cryogenic conditions. We find that free-space collective incoherent interactions, typically associated with sub- and superradiance, can modify the traditional resonant energy transfer scaling with distance. The same holds true for cavity-mediated collective incoherent interactions in a weak-coupling but strong-cooperativity regime. In the strong coupling regime, we elucidate the effect of pumping into cavity polaritons and analytically identify an optimal energy flow regime characterized by equal donor/acceptor Hopfield coefficients in the middle polariton. Finally we quantify the build-up of quantum correlations in the donor-acceptor system via the two-qubit concurrence as a measure of entanglement.",

        content: [
          para: "The theoretical study of photoluminescence (PL) has been hindered in the past due to lack of predictive ab initio numerical techniques [1,2,4]. We present a complete framework for the computation of PL where electrons, nuclei, and photons are quantised. The intrinsic non-equilibrium nature of the process is fully taken into account [3]. We derive a set of equations for the Green's functions of electrons, phonons, and photons where the different kinds of interactions are treated on the same footing. These equations are then simplified by using the generalised Baym-Kadanoff ansatz and the completed collision approximation [3]. This reduces the problem to a set of decoupled equations for the density matrix that describe all kinds of static and dynamical correlations. We show how the micro-macro connection relates the observable spectrum with the time-dependent microscopic dynamics, via the BSE. Finally, we present the results of our numerical studies on 2D materials, such as WS2, where we relate the evolution of the carrier populations in the Brillouin zone with the changes in the PL spectrum of the material, for a range of experimental setups.",

        content: [
          para: "In the present work we face the question: Whether and to what extent the analysis and simulation of photoinduced processes changes by going beyond the classical Maxwell description. Here we generalize the idea of the ensemble trajectories, traditionally introduced for electron-nuclear problems, to electron-photon correlated systems, where we focus on well-known semiclassical methods like mean-field and path-integral approach. We apply our novel approaches to spontaneous and stimulated emission for atoms and molecules in optical cavities.",
          para: "However, considering the free photonic field being described by harmonic Hamiltonians, the coupling to the matter within dipole approximation and starting the Wigner dynamics with a Gaussian wavepacket, we find that the results are accurate but not exact, although observation suggests that classical Wigner dynamics for harmonic potentials up to a linear coupling should describe the motion exact. This implies that the true potential driving the photonic motion is in fact not harmonic. To further investigate this, we introduce the exact-factorization approach and therewith time-dependent potential energy-surfaces for electron-photon interaction.",

While the theoretical description of such fermion-boson systems is usually done with effective model Hamiltonians, I will show how a recently developed extension of density-functional theory to coupled matter-photon systems termed quantum-electrodynamical density-functional theory (QEDFT) [1] allows us to treat hybrid light-matter systems from first principles [2]. I introduce a linear-response formulation of QEDFT that does not only allow to determine the emerging polaritonic spectra but also novel types of response functions like photon-photon responses due to the coupling to quantum matter from first principles. Within a simple model system I will exemplify these concepts and finally show first ab-initio results for a real molecule strongly coupled to the modes of a high-Q optical cavity.",

E_g-symmetry coherent phonons can be excited in group-V semimetals by ultrafast (<100 fs) optical pulses when the radiation is polarised perpendicular to the 3-fold symmetry axis of the crystal. The electronic driving force of this phonon is consistent with an initially unbalanced occupation of electronic states in symmetry-equivalent regions of the Brillouin zone, which decays to fully-symmetric occupation of the zone on fs timescales.  The temperature-dependence of the decay time of the force in Bi and Sb, measured by Li et. al. [1], suggested relaxation of the excited electronic distribution by electron-phonon scattering.",
          para: "We calculate the decay of the low-symmetry E_g driving force in Bi, Sb and As from first principles. We calculate the electronic energies, phonon spectrum and electron-phonon matrix elements using density functional perturbation theory. We calculate the initial excited electronic distribution, evolve the distribution using a rate-equation approach and calculate the atomic forces at each time-step. We obtain good agreement with experiment for Bi and Sb, showing that electron-phonon scattering is the dominant relaxation mechanism for the E_g force. We also predict the decay rate for E_g forces in photo-excited As.",

          para: "Many chemical processes of biological or industrial relevance occur in the condensed phase, for instance a solvent or a protein matrix. Therefore, computational methods that can treat condensed phases efficiently, yet accurate, are called for. Utilizing that most chemical properties are local and high accuracy therefore only is required for a smaller part, many methods employ a separation of the total system into two parts: The chemically relevant part is treated by quantum mechanical (QM) methods whereas the remaining system is treated with the more approximate, but appreciatively faster, molecular mechanics (MM) methods [1]. Despite rather successful, these QM/MM hybrids often involve severe approximations for the interaction between the QM system and the MM part, where the latter is often represented by point-charges.   In this talk, I will introduce the QM/MM scheme and discuss methods that go beyond the simple point-charge description of the environment[2,3], using examples from my own research [4,5]. Selected applications for condensed phases and proteins [4–6] will be discussed.",

Nonetheless, it is still a grand challenge to perform atomistic simulations of complex models of catalysts at finite temperature and realistic conditions that take into account metal particle distribution, reactant/product networks, and support materials. In this talk, we will introduce our recent ab initio molecular dynamics and kinetic simulations on oxide-supported gold catalysis and show how the catalysis features such as catalyst structure, adsorption/diffusion process, charge transfer, and the reaction mechanisms are dynamically behaved and how they can be controlled by adjusting the operative parameters. This strongly implies the importance in understating catalysis dynamic behaviors under realistic conditions."

Compared with locally optimized structures, our new structures have lower total energies and significantly smaller interface energies. We observed some recurrent geometrical features of the lowest energy interfaces: Si atoms prefer to form spiral structures rather than simple rings. Concerning the electronic properties, defect energy levels in the band gap of locally-optimized interfaces can disappear after interface reconstruction. Our investigation suggests that global structural prediction is extremely important to predict the effect on transport and optical properties of grain boundaries in semiconductors.",
